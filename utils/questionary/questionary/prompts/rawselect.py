    This is just a really basic example, the prompt can be customised using the
    parameters.

    Args:
        message: Question text.

        choices: Items shown in the selection, this can contain :class:`Choice` or
                 or :class:`Separator` objects or simple items as strings. Passing
                 :class:`Choice` objects, allows you to configure the item more
                 (e.g. preselecting it or disabling it).

        default: Default return value (single value).

        qmark: Question prefix displayed in front of the question.
               By default this is a ``?``.

        pointer: Pointer symbol in front of the currently highlighted element.
                 By default this is a ``»``.
                 Use ``None`` to disable it.

        style: A custom color and style for the question parts. You can
               configure colors as well as font types for different elements.

    Returns:
        :class:`Question`: Question instance, ready to be prompted (using ``.ask()``).
